            The wager was to "study the possibility of erecting an iron tower on the Champ-de-Mars with a square <br> base, 125 metres across and 300 metres tall". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of Gustave <br> Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre,<br> an architect, that was accepted.
            
            Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in Eiffel's<br> company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884. It was to be designed like a large pylon with four<br> columns of lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at the top, and joined to each other <br>by more metal girders at regular intervals.
            
            The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a <br>height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000 feet. On September 18 1884 Eiffel<br> registered a patent "for a new configuration allowing the construction of metal supports and pylons capable <br>of exceeding a height of 300 metres".
            
            In order to make the project more acceptable to public opinion, <br>Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned the architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the project's appearance.</button>
